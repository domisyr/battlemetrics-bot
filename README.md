## BM Status Bot - A Telegram Selenium Monitoring Bot

This bot uses Selenium to monitor a specific status on a website and notifies you via Telegram as soon as the status changes. It is designed to run reliably on servers or devices like a Raspberry Pi and can be fully controlled through Telegram commands.

The focus is on simplicity, reliability, and clear control via Telegram.

### 🚀 Features
- Telegram bot based on python-telegram-bot
- Website monitoring using Selenium (Chrome / Chromium)
- Automatic periodic checks
- Telegram notifications on status changes
- Multilingual support (English / German)
- Full control via Telegram commands
- Configuration via .env file
- Suitable for Raspberry Pi and server environments

⸻

### 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Google Chrome or Chromium
- Matching ChromeDriver
- Telegram Bot Token

Python dependencies (see requirements.txt):

python-telegram-bot
selenium
python-dotenv


⸻

### 🚀 Quick Install (Recommended)

Run this single command in the project folder to install dependencies, setup the bot, and enable auto-start:

```bash
bash install.sh
```
⸻

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <REPO-URL>
cd <REPO-FOLDER>
```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

⸻

### 🔐 Configuration

Create a .env file

Create a .env file in the project root directory:
```bash
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token

TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
```
💡 The chat ID is required so the bot knows where it is allowed to send messages.

⸻

### 🧠 How it works
- The bot periodically opens a website using Selenium
- A specific element or status is extracted
- Changes are detected and compared with the last known state
- When a change occurs, you receive a Telegram notification

The last known status is stored internally to prevent notification spam.

If this bot runs reliably, you set it up correctly. If it doesn’t, the issue is almost always Selenium or the runtime environment — not the bot itself. Stay patient, it’s worth it.
